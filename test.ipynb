    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AI-based Compliance Check System** leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically identify potential **violations of fair housing and compensation rules** within textual data such as **public agent remarks, internal communications, and property descriptions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses advanced **contextual and semantic understanding** to detect subtle or indirect rule violations that traditional keyword or rule-based systems may miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- ⚙️ **Contextual understanding** of natural language using LLMs.\n",
    "- 🏠 **Fair housing compliance** detection from public-facing texts.\n",

    "     - ✅ **Compliant**\n",
    "     - ⚠️ **Potential Violation**\n",
    "     - ❌ **Violation Detected**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explanation Generator**\n",
    "   - Summarizes why a violation was (or wasn’t) detected.\n",
    "   - Provides natural-language reasoning to aid human reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Storage & Reporting**\n",
    "   - Logs all compliance checks, LLM responses, and explanations.\n",
    "   - Feeds dashboards or audit reports.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. Function Signature Alignment\n",
    "- Updated all rule function tests to use positional parameters\n",
    "- Fixed test calls to match actual implementation: `func(public_remarks, private_remarks, directions)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. Mock Response Structure\n",
    "- Updated mocks to use OpenAI Responses API (`responses.create`) instead of Chat Completions\n",
    "- Fixed mock structure to use `output_text` with JSON-fenced code blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. Module Patching\n",
    "- Changed patching from non-existent `app.api.routes.client` to actual `app.rules.base.client`\n",
    "- Simplified custom rule tests to avoid patching computed paths\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 4. API Request Format\n",
    "- Updated integration tests to use correct `AIViolationID` format\n",
    "- Fixed data structure to include `mlsnum` and `mls_id` fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 5. APIError Construction\n",
    "- Fixed APIError mocks to include `request=MagicMock()` parameter\n",
    "- Added `status_code=500` attribute for retryable errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 6. Response Parser Enhancement\n",
    "- Enhanced `response_parser` with bracket-matching logic\n",
    "- Now handles JSON with leading/trailing text\n",
    "- Extracts first JSON object from complex strings\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 7. Rate Limiter Edge Cases\n",
    "- Fixed `parse_reset_time()` to return 60.0 for invalid input instead of 0.0\n",
    "- Added proper error handling for edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 8. Registry Function Parameters\n",
    "- Fixed all test calls to use correct parameter order: `get_rule_function(mls_id, rule_id)`\n",
    "- Updated column expectations to match actual registry (Remarks, PrivateRemarks, Directions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 9. Response Assertions\n",
    "- Updated assertions to check correct response structure (`ok` field, proper error format)\n",
    "- Fixed expected status codes (400 for invalid rules, 422 for validation errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 10. HTTP Client Teardown\n",
    "- Added `hasattr` check in `main.py` shutdown to prevent AttributeError\n",
    "\n",

    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Rate Limiter (`app/core/rate_limiter.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Dynamically manages OpenAI API rate limits to prevent 429 errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- Reads actual limits from OpenAI response headers\n",
    "- Tracks token and request budgets in real-time\n",
    "- Adjusts concurrency dynamically (10-200 concurrent calls)\n",
    "- Auto-pauses when approaching limits (90% safety margin)\n",
    "- Model-agnostic (works with any OpenAI model)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Before API Call:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rate_limiter = get_rate_limiter()\n",
    "estimated = rate_limiter.estimate_tokens(\"Some text\")\n",
    "await rate_limiter.wait_if_needed(estimated)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **After API Call:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "await rate_limiter.update_from_headers(response)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration:**\n",
    "- `SAFETY_MARGIN`: 0.9 (use 90% of available budget)\n",
    "- `MIN_CONCURRENCY`: 10\n",
    "- `MAX_CONCURRENCY`: 200\n",
    "- `DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY`: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Estimation:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Estimates tokens: characters / 4\n",
    "estimated_tokens = len(text) / CHARS_PER_TOKEN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Concurrency:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Budget > 80% → 200 concurrent calls\n",
    "Budget 60-80% → 150 concurrent calls\n",
    "Budget 40-60% → 100 concurrent calls\n",
    "Budget 20-40% → 50 concurrent calls\n",
    "Budget < 20% → 10 concurrent calls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Retry Handler (`app/core/retry_handler.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Automatically retries failed API calls with exponential backoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retry Strategy:**\n",
    "- Attempt 1: Wait 1s + jitter\n",
    "- Attempt 2: Wait 2s + jitter\n",
    "- Attempt 3: Wait 4s + jitter\n",
    "- Max delay capped at 16s\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Gets Retried:**\n",
    "- ✅ `RateLimitError` (429) - Rate limit hit\n",
    "- ✅ `APITimeoutError` - Request timeout\n",
    "- ✅ `APIError` (5xx) - Server errors (500, 502, 503, 504)\n",
    "- ✅ `ConnectionError` - Network connection issues\n",
    "- ✅ `TimeoutError` - Socket timeout\n",
    "- ✅ `OSError` - Network-level errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Doesn't Get Retried:**\n",
    "- ❌ `APIError` (4xx) - Client errors (400, 401, 403, 404)\n",
    "- ❌ Programming errors\n",
    "- ❌ Validation errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@retry_with_backoff(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0)\n",
    "async def my_api_call():\n",
    "    response = await client.responses.create(...)\n",
    "    return response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jitter:**\n",
    "Random delay (0-1s) added to prevent thundering herd problem when multiple requests retry simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Rule Functions (`app/rules/base.py`)\n",

    "## Rate Limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Rate Limiting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Rate limiter starts with no knowledge of limits\n",
    "   - First API call returns limits in headers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Header Parsing:**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-limit-tokens: 10000000\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens: 9999850\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-reset-tokens: 6ms\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-limit-requests: 10000\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-remaining-requests: 9999\n",
    "   x-ratelimit-reset-requests: 6ms\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Budget Tracking:**\n",
    "   - Token budget: `remaining / limit = 99.998%`\n",
    "   - Request budget: `remaining / limit = 99.99%`\n",
    "   - Overall budget: `min(token_budget, request_budget)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wait Logic:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if estimated_tokens > (remaining * SAFETY_MARGIN):\n",
    "       await asyncio.sleep(reset_time)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dynamic Concurrency:**\n",
    "   - Adjusts based on budget percentage\n",
    "   - More budget = more concurrent calls\n",
    "   - Less budget = fewer concurrent calls\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Test with Single Request:**\n",
    "Isolate issues by testing one listing at a time.\n",

    "4. **Check OpenAI Status:**\n",
    "Visit [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Verify API Key:**\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "## API Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Batch Requests:**\n",
    "   - Send multiple listings in one request\n",
    "   - API processes them in parallel\n",
    "   - Reduces network overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Appropriate Rules:**\n",
    "   - Only check rules you need\n",
    "   - Each rule = one OpenAI API call\n",
    "   - 3 rules × 10 listings = 30 API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Field Selection:**\n",
    "   - Only include necessary CheckColumns\n",
    "   - Reduces token usage\n",
    "   - Faster processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retry Logic:**\n",
    "   - Client should implement retries for 5xx errors\n",
    "   - Don't retry 4xx errors (client errors)\n",
    "   - Use exponential backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Request IDs:**\n",
    "   - Save request IDs from responses\n",
    "   - Include in support requests\n",
    "   - Use for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation:**\n",
    "   - Validate data client-side before sending\n",
    "   - Check required fields exist\n",
    "   - Verify rule IDs are valid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connection Reuse:**\n",
    "   - Use HTTP/1.1 keep-alive\n",
    "   - Reuse connections when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compression:**\n",
    "   - Enable gzip compression\n",
    "   - Reduces payload size\n",
    "\n",
